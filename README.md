I have extended Matt Welch's awesome example integration of Automatic with Salesforce.com. Currently implementing only Automatic webhook support.

For more information, see [this post](http://mattwel.ch/automatic-for-the-people/ "mattwel.ch").

I have added handlers for Mil(Check Engine), Hard Brake, Hard Accel and Ignition On.
